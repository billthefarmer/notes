## Help
You may put a link `[Help](file:///android_asset/help.md)` to the help
file in the app assets in a note. The file will be loaded and may be
saved using the **Save as** menu entry.

## Double tap
In the formatted view a double tap on the screen will switch to the
edit view in approximately the same position in the markdown text. The
accuracy is dependent on the text formatting and media in the note.

## Editing
In the formatted view the **Edit** button floating above the page
allows editing notes. The **Accept** button restores the formatted
view. A long touch on the button hides it until the device is rotated
or a long touch on the page.

See [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for
markdown syntax.

## Scrolling
Scrolling the page up will temporarily hide the floating
button. Scrolling down restores it.

## Search
You may search notes, the search will update as text is entered into
the search field. Use the search widget or keyboard action button to
find the next match. To find and edit text, search in the markdown
view, and then double tap where you want to edit. This will switch to
the edit view at about the right place.

## Find all
You may find all notes that contain the current search text. This menu
item will only appear while the search widget is active. A dialog will
pop up with a list of matching notes. Touch an entry to open that
note. You may repeat this or refine the search text to find the
desired note.

## Keyboard shortcuts
When using an external keyboard, some keyboard shortcuts are
implemented:
 * Ctrl+D &ndash; Done
 * Ctrl+E &ndash; Edit
 * Ctrl+F &ndash; Search
 * Ctrl+Shift+F &ndash; Close search
 * Ctrl+Alt+F &ndash; Find next
 * Ctrl+M &ndash; Show menu
 * Ctrl+N &ndash; New note
 * Ctrl+O &ndash; Open note
 * Ctrl+P &ndash; Print note
 * Ctrl+S &ndash; Save note
 * Ctrl+Shift+S &ndash; Save as
 * F3 &ndash; Find next
 * F10 &ndash; Show menu

## Template
You may use a new note template. If a template is set it will be
copied to a new note. A date code &ndash; `<<date>>` may be inserted
into the template which will be converted into the current date and
time. Alternatively a date pattern may be added to the code &ndash;
`<<date EEEE d MMMM yyyy HH:mm>>` for a custom date format. See
[here](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat#date-and-time-patterns)
for the pattern documentation.

## Name template
You may use a template for new note names. If a template is set it
will be used for the name of new notes. A date code &ndash; `<<date>>`
may be inserted into the template which will be converted into the
current date and time. This will default to `yyyy/MM/dd-HHmmss`, which
will expand to `2022/02/20-113052`, so `<<date>>.md` will give
`2022/02/20-113052.md`. This gives a hierarchical folder structure
similar to my [Diary](https://github.com/billthefarmer/diary)
app. Alternatively you may use your own date pattern for a custom
name, as above.

## Text
You may receive text clips from another app. The text will be added at
the current cursor position, or in a new note if no note is open.

## Media
You may store media in the note storage folder and reference them in
notes, so markdown text `![cat](cat.jpg)` will display `cat.jpg`
stored in the note folder. You may either add media from media
providers like file managers or image managers or receive media sent
by other apps. Media added will be added at the current cursor
position. Media sent by other apps will be added at the current cursor
position, or in a new note if no note is open. Content URIs
(`content://`) sent by some media providers and apps will be resolved
to file URIs (`file:///`) if possible. Media will be added using
markdown image syntax (`![<name>](<url>)`), which will be parsed into
an HTML5 media player, text clips will be added as above, URLs will be
added as a link. Media added from removable SD cards not part of the
device storage may work but may not be persistent and is not supported.

## Markdown
Notes supports several markdown extensions including autolink, tables
using vertical bar characters, heading anchor, underlining using
`++underline++`, strikethrough using `~~strike~~`, YAML front matter,
task lists using `- [x] task #1`, `- [ ] task #2`, superscript using
`^super^`, subscript using `~sub~`.

## Task lists
To change the state of check boxes in a task list, switch to the edit
view and tap on the box `[ ]`. The box will change state and the edit
cursor will be where you tapped.

## LaTeX
Notes doesn't support [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
but it is possible to use an external site to add LaTeX formatted
images.

    ![Math](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}
        &bc=cornsilk&fc=black&im=jpg&fs=24&ff=arev)

    \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}

![Math](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}&bc=cornsilk&fc=black&im=jpg&fs=24&ff=arev)

If you don't intend to change the image, you can copy it and use that
instead, which will then work offline.

## Svgbob
Notes doesn't support text diagrams, but will display SVG images
produced by an online editor [Svgbob
Editor](https://svgbob-editor.netlify.app/).

![Svgbob](https://github.com/billthefarmer/billthefarmer.github.io/raw/master/images/diary/bob.svg)

## Links
You may put external links in notes, so
`[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)` will show a link to
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). Links will be followed if
touched. Use the back button in the toolbar or the navigation bar to
return to the note. Links to other notes may added as a relative
reference `[AnotherNote](AnotherNote.md)`.

## Maps
You may put [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) maps in
notes with a geo URI `![osm](geo:<lat>,<lng>)`. Geo uris received from
other apps will be added at the current cursor position, or in a new
note if no note is open.

## Cursor position
You may put a line in a note to control or remember the edit cursor
position. This will not appear in the markdown view. Put `[<]: #` on a
line for the start of an note, `[>]: #` for the end of a note. Put
`[#]: #` for the cursor position to be remembered. There should be no
other text on the line. The current cursor position will be added when
the note is saved `[#]: # (nnn)`. Because notes are only saved if they
are changed, moving the cursor with no other change will not move the
saved position.

## Styles
You may add custom styles to the markdown formatting by placing a
`styles.css` file in the `Notes/css` folder, which will replace the
built in styles file which simply limits the width of images to the
page width. Use the built in editor to create a styles file. You must
use the editor `accept` tick button to save the edits.

**Caution** &ndash; There is no such thing as a markdown syntax error, but
syntax errors in a styles file may cause unpredictable results and
affect all notes. See [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/Css).

You may include the built in styles file with an `@import` statement
`@import "file:///android_asset/styles.css";` or `@import
url("file:///android_asset/styles.css");`, which should be on the
first line.

## Javascript
You may add custom javascript to be loaded into all notes by placing a
`script.js` file in the `Notes/js` folder. Use the built in editor to
create a script file. You must use the editor `accept` tick button to
save the edits. Errors in the script will be logged by the
[WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView)
which displays the page. See [Javascript
tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js).

If you want to use javascript libraries or write a large script it
might be a good idea to use the Google
[Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler) to
check and minimise your code. It will handle multiple input files.

## Emojies
There is a script, [emojies.js](data/emojies.js) in the data folder
and a minimised version, [emojies.min.js](data/emojies.min.js). Either
may be copied to the `script.js` file as above. The script is a work
in progress, it could do with some TLC from an expert.

## Backup
You may create a backup of all your notes in a zip file. The file
defaults to the same name as the notes folder, `Notes.zip`, but may be
changed using the dialog, or by using the **Storage** button to save
the backup using the android file manager.

## Sync
Android cloud storage apps when last tested appeared not to be capable
of syncing a real storage folder on the device. However
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) does just that and can sync your
notes folder with other devices and desktop computers.

## Removable SD cards
Android allows removable SD cards to be used like a USB stick or as
part of the device storage. Notes opened using the chooser on a
removable SD card may not save successfully using the save button. Use
the **Save as** menu item and the **Storage** button to save it using
the android file manager. Alternatively use the **Storage** button on
the chooser dialog to open the Note using the android file manager.

## Settings
